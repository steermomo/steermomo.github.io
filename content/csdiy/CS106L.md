> Explores the modern C++ language in depth.

I will try to write in English in this article. And of course, this may have a lot of syntax errors or some typo, anyway, this is my first step.

I have studied c++ years before, mainly used on leetcode, and have less knowledge of modern c++.
So I choose CS106L as a new start, to learn how to design modern code.
